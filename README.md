# STM32F103-CAN-example

This repo contains a basic example for communicating between two STM32F103C8T6 microcontrollers over CAN bus. Make sure that the CAN Tx/Rx pins of both the microcontrollers are connected properly and that the correct CAN transceivers are being used. Each of these folders contains a STM32CubeIDE project.
